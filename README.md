Quantum Interference — Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)
Qiskit simulation of quantum interference, phase control, and which-path detection


What is the MZI?

The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer is one of the deepest experiments in quantum mechanics. It provides direct proof of superposition, the most fundamental quantum mechanical nature of particles.
When a single photon enters the MZI, it does not take one path or the other. It takes a superposition of both paths simultaneously and undergoes interference with itself. This is why every photon ends up fully at one detector while the other detector sees complete darkness — not because of any classical wave effect, but because of quantum interference of a single particle with itself.
This experiment also reveals a strange character of the photon: the photon appears to know the existence of a path it did not take. And when you try to find out which path it took, that knowledge destroys the interference completely — proving that for quantum particles, realism is not applicable.


MZI in Qiskit

In Qiskit, the MZI maps directly to quantum gates:

Real MZI	Qiskit
Beam splitter 1	H gate
Path length difference	RZ(θ) gate
Beam splitter 2	H gate
Detector	Measurement


Notebooks

01 — MZI Basic

Tests four phase values and shows how the detector outcome changes:

Phase (θ)	Result	Physical meaning
0	{'0': 1000}	Constructive interference — all photons to D0
π/2	{'0': ~500, '1': ~500}	Partial interference
π	{'1': 1000}	Destructive interference — all photons to D1


02 — Phase Sweep

Runs the MZI 50 times, sweeping θ continuously from 0 to 2π. Plots the full interference pattern showing how P(|1⟩) follows a smooth sine curve — controlled entirely by phase.


03 — Which Path Experiment

Places a measurement between the two beam splitters — equivalent to putting a detector on one path of the MZI. The moment which-path information is obtained, superposition collapses and interference is completely destroyed. Result goes from {'1': 1000} to a random ~25% distribution across all outcomes.


Results

Basic MZI — No Phase vs π Phase

No phase: all photons to D0
π phase: all photons to D1


Phase Sweep — Interference Pattern

Smooth sine curve from 0 to 2π showing continuous control of interference by phase.


Which Path — Interference Destroyed

Normal MZI (π phase): {'1': 1000}
Which path measurement: {'10': ~250, '01': ~250, '00': ~250, '11': ~250}
